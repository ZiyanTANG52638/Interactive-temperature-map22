   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/interactive-temperature-map.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd interactive-temperature-map
3. **Start a local server**:
   Using Python (Example):
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
By default, the server runs on http://localhost:8000.

Using VSCode Live Server:
- Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

## Project Structure
The project files are organized as follows:
- index.html: The main HTML file containing the form, map, and JavaScript logic.
- README.md: The documentation file you are currently reading.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Markup for the web page structure.
- CSS3: Styling for the map and UI elements.
- JavaScript (ES6): Logic for user input, map interaction, and marker updates.
- Leaflet.js: Open-source JavaScript library for map visualizations.
- Mapbox: Satellite imagery and tiles for the map.

## Features Overview
Map Features:
- Satellite imagery provided by Mapbox.
- Dynamic zooming based on marker locations.
- Interactive popups displaying user-submitted data.
Form Features:
- Input validation for latitude, longitude, and temperature.
- Support for uploading and displaying images in popups.

## How to Extend the Project
1. Back-End Integration:
   - Connect the form submission to a back-end service using Node.js and Express.
   - Store user submissions (nickname, latitude, longitude, temperature, and photo) in a MongoDB database.
3. Enhanced Map Features:
   - Add clustering for markers to improve map readability with multiple submissions.
   - Display additional weather data using a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
5. User Authentication:
   - Add login functionality to allow users to save and manage their submissions.
